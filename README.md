#NTC's forum on PocketCHIP

This project lets you browse [NTC's forum](https://bbs.nextthing.co) directly on the PocketCHIP with surf.

## How does it work ?
You only need to downlaod the CSS stylesheet and launch the command :
`surf -t main.css https://bbs.nextthing.co`
to go on the website

## Known bugs :
- The `Log out` button is not visible/clickable
- Some menus are still too big
